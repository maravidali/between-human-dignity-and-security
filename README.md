## Project Overview

This paper investigates, in the aftermath of a humanitarian crisis, the conditions under which citizens and elites support the establishment of migrant and refugee hosting facilities in their local area, and what types of facilities they prefer.

It explores the concerns underlying counter-crisis policy preferences and how these vary by ideology and elite status. The analysis focuses on Greece—a critical European case—using original data from a nationally representative survey of **5,916 citizens** and **586 elites**, including open-ended responses.

Using a combination of **experimental** and **text analysis** methods, the findings reveal:

- Strong preferences for **national-level control and containment** in migration and refugee reception;
- The emergence of **axes of polarization** around the trade-off between **human dignity** and **security concerns**;
- These divides are **more pronounced among citizens** than elites.
